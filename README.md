# Keycaps
Models of common keycaps created in Solidworks 2016 and saved as STLs at 4 resolutions.

The models are based on hand measurements taken from the samples I have available and therefore I cannot guarantee their accuracy.

The underside of the keycaps have the mount but are otherwise not accurate.

The following profiles are included:
* DSA
* SA

I plan to include the following:
* DCS
* Anything else I get hold of
